# Linear-Regression-On-Boston-Dataset

In this code I trained the Boston Dataset on Linear Regression model.

**What is Linear Regression:**
  linear regression is a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. The case of one explanatory  variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. 
  
  
I trained the model on following types of Linear Regression:
    
    1) Univariate Linear Regression.
    2) Multivariate Linear Regression.
    3) Polynomial Linear Regression.
    
After training, I again trained the model with scaling technique applied on Univariate, Multivariate and Polynomial Linear Regression to check the difference between simple training and training after scaling is applied on the Boston dataset
